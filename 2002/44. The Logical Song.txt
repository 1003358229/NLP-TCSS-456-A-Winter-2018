When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
Oh it was beautiful
Magical

And all the birds in the trees
They could sing so happily
So joyfully
Oh playfully watching me

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
Oh it was beautiful
Magical

And all the birds in the trees
They could sing so happily
So joyfully
Oh playfully watching me

It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
