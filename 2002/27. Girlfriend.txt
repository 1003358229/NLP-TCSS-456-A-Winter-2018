Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
Would you be my girlfriend?
(I like you baby)
Would you be my girlfriend?

I don't know why you care (why you thinkin' bout him huh?)
He doesn't even know you're there
'Cause he don't love your eyes
And he don't love your smile
Girl you know that ain't fair

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea

Won't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Does he know what you feel (know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real (are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind
Or does he break your stride?
Did you know that love could be a shield yeah
In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry (oh no)
Is he gonna stand by your side? (no no) Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea (listen girl)

Won't you be my girlfriend (yeah yeah)
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend... oh

Won't you be my girlfriend (yeah)
I'll treat you good (uh) I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'cause if you were my girlfriend (my girlfriend)
I'd be your shining star (shining star)
The one to show you where you are

Girl you should be my girlfriend
My baby ... (you make my heart sing)
My baby (girl you make my heart sing)

Girl you should be... my girlfriend
Girl you should be... my girlfriend
Girl you should be... my girlfriend (it's destiny)
Girl you should be... my girlfriend
Girl you should be... my girlfriend
