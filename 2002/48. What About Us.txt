Why don't you return my calls
Why you trip 'bout where I be
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy
What the hell I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind
I can find another guy
someone who will treat me right
I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up, with it
Any longer, you can
Go if you want, I don't
Need your pity, I will
Be just fine if, you decide
That you want to leave, close the
Door behind you, I just
Want to know what...
What about all of the, things that you say
What about all of the, promises that you made
What about all of the, ICE that you gave
What about all of the, things you told me
What about all of the, things that you said
What about all of the, promises that you made
What about all of the, ICE that you gave
What about, what about,
What about us...What about us, us
What about us...What about us, us
Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say
Said that you loved only me
Thought that you'd be all I need
What happened to promises
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
'Cause you're counterfeit I see
I don't need this, bullshit
I won't put up, with this
Any longer, you can
Go if you want, I don't
Need your pity, I will
Be just fine if, you decide
That you want to leave, close the
Door behind you, I just
Want to know what
What about all of the, things that you say
What about all of the, promises that you made
What about all of the, ICE that you gave
What about all of the, things you told me
Baby check it out hear this
Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game you played, I picked it
Now what if I said I wasn't true, so do you
You and I know, without me there's no you
So what about bills that were past due, paid for you
All you said to me is "Baby I owe you"
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Don't what about us to me, cause we are through
"What about us..."
What about all of the, things that you say
What about all of the, promises that you made
What about all of the, ICE that you gave
What about all of the, things you told me
What about all of the, things that you say
What about all of the, promises that you made
What about all of the, ICE that you gave
What about all of the, things you told me
What about us..."What about us"
What about us..."What about us"
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh...Darkchild...
