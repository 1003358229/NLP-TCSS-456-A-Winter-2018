I feel so close to you right now
It's a force feel
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love bows down, I mean surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force feel
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love bows down, I mean surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now
