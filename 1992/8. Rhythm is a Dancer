Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it, yeah
Oh, it's a passion
Oh
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air
How very like the future this place might be
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the kingdom of one knowledgeable worker
Feel a wave of loneliness, head back down
I'm going too fast (I'm going too fast)
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air, oh
I plunge right on through the office door
And into the bottomless center below
Suddenly I can't remember how to stop, turn around
Or point behind myself
Do I have to turn around before I can point
I flip into a break
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air, oh
