I've been watching you
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
C'mon
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Hey
Standing across the room I saw you smile
I said I want to talk to yo-o-ou, for a little while
But before I make my move my emotions start running wild
My tongue gets tied and that's no lie
I'm looking in your eyes, I'm looking in you big brown eyes
Ooh yeah, and I've got this to say to you, hey
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it some more
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it, push it, push it some more
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
C'mon
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long, ooh
So I said to myself, "If she loves me or not?
But the dreads done know that love is his to get
With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
The lyrics goes on the attack, my tongue gets tied and that's no lie
I'm looking in your eyes, I'm looking in your big brown eyes
Ooh girl, and I've got this to say to you, hey
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it some more
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it, push it, push it some more
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Ooh, yeah
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
One more time
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Sing it
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Hey
Woo, woo, woo, woo, wee, yeah, eyes
I'm lookin' in your big brown eyes, ooh yeah
And I've got this to say to you, hey
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it some more
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it, push it, push it some more
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Yeah
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Push it, push it some more
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Alright

Push it, push it some more
