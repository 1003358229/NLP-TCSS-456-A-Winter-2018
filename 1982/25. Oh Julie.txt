Whoa, whoa Julie, if you love me truly,
Do you want me, Julie, to be, be your very own?
Julie, love me only, Julie, don't be lonely,
'cause I want you only to be, to be my very own.
Ooh, Baby, don't leave me, honey, don't grieve me,
Julie, why leave me alone?
Stay with me, baby, lay with me maybe,
Honey, don't leave me alone!
Julie, never leave me, please, don't decieve me!
Julie, oh, believe me and be, be my very own.
(Solo)
Whoa, whoa, Julie, if you love me truly...
Ooh, Baby, don't leave me, honey, don't grieve me...
Julie, never leave me, please don't decieve me...
Whoa, whoa Julie, if you love me truly...
To be, to be, to be, be your very own.
To be, to be, to be, to be your very own.
