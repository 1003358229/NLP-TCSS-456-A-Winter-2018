See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watchin' all their feet
They don't know where they're want to go
But their walking in time
They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat
See the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line
They got the beat
They got the beat
Kids got the beat
Yeah, kids got the beat
Go-Go music really makes us dance
Do the pony, puts us in a trance
Do what you see just give us a chance
That's when we fall in line
'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Yeah, we got it
We got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
Everybody get on your feet
(We got the beat)
We know you can dance to the beat
(We got the beat)
Jumpin' and get down
(We got the beat)
Round and round and round
We got the beat
We got the beat
We got the beat
