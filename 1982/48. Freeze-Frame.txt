Freeze-frame
I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound
Thursday morning was a hot flash-factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip, proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame, now freeze
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feelings just won't disappear
Close-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame, now freeze
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame) 
Freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame, now freeze
Freeze-frame 
Freeze-frame 
Like a freeze-frame (freeze-frame)
Freeze-frame
It's like the freeze, she's breeze
Freeze-frame
It's like the freeze, she's
Freeze-frame
Freeze-frame
Freeze-frame
