There's something about the weather
That everybody loves
They call it the Indian spring of Sacramento
And when the sun is up in the sky
The wind is blowin' by the riverside most everyday
You're in Sacramento a wonderful town
Sing sing sing din din din
There's something about the people
That everybody knows
That gives you a tender feelin' of confusion
You're feelin' lonely but you don't know
Until this other feelin' here inside you starts to grow
You're in Sacramento, a wonderful town
Sing sing sing din din din
Now that spring is here again
And you're thinkin' if only you were not so lonely ooh ooh
But you can ease your restless mind
Ease your restless mind
All the people are a lovin' kind,
In Sacramento
There's something about the weather
That everybody loves
They call it the Indian spring of Sacramento
You're feelin' lonely, but you don't know
Until this other feelin' here inside you starts to grow
You're in Sacramento, a wonderful town
Sing sing sing din din din
Sacramento
