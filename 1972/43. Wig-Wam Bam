Hiawatha didn't bother too much
About Minnie Ha-Ha and her tender touch
Till she took him to the silver stream
Then she whispered words like he'd never heard
That made him all shudder inside when she said

Wig-wam bam, gonna make you my man
Wam bam bam, gonna get you if I can
Wig-wam bam, wanna make you understand
Try a little touch, try a little too much
Just try a little wig-wam bam

Running Bear never cared enough
About Little White Dove and her tender love
Till she took him to the silver stream
She told him all about what he couldn't live without
And made him all weak inside when she said

Wig-wam bam, gonna make you my man
Wam bam bam, gonna get you if I can
Wig-wam bam, wanna make you understand
Try a little touch, try a little too much
Just try a little wig-wam bam

Wig-wam, bam sham-a-lam
Wam bam, bam sham-a-lam
Wig-wam, bam sham-a-lam
Wam bam, bam sham-a-lam

Hiawatha didn't bother too much
About Minnie Ha-Ha and her tender touch
Till she took him to the silver stream
Then she whispered words like he'd never heard
That made him all shudder inside when she said

Wig-wam bam, gonna make you my man
Wam bam bam, gonna get you if I can
Wig-wam bam, wanna make you understand
Try a little touch, try a little too much
Just try a little wig-wam bam, and she said

Wig-wam bam, gonna make you my man
Wam bam bam, gonna get you if I can
Wig-wam bam, wanna make you understand
Try a little touch, try a little too much
Just try a little wig-wam

Wig-wam bam, gonna make you my man
Wam bam bam, gonna get you if I can
Wig-wam bam, wanna make you understand
Try a little touch, try a little too much
