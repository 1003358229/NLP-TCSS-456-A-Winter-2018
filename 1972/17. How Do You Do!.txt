Once I said I wanted you, I don't remember why
I often wonder if it's true, that you could make me cry
I only know it's long ago, you said, I love you too
But I got one solution left, we're gonna start anew
How do you do? mmm mmm
I thought why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can, na-na, na-na
Just like before
And you will say, na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think, na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I am living for
How do you do? hoe-hoe
Once I said I wanted you and I remember why
I often wonder if it's true, you still can make me cry
And now it's not so long ago, you said, I love you too
'Cause I had one solution left and that's to start anew
How do you do? mmm
How do you do? hoe-hoe
