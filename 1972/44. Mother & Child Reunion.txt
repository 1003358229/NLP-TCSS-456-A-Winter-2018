No I would not give no false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine, I care for the life of me
Remember a sadder day, that now they say let be
Just don't recount on me in the course of a lifetime run
Over and over again
No I would not give no false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh, little darling of mine, I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say, I never been laid so low
Such a mysterious way and the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again
No I would not give no false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
