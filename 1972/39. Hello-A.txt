I understand that all men can't be the same
But the way you treated me
When we met was more than strange
 
I could not care less
The only thing that counts is
The fact that for bad manners
I've got you in exchange
 
Hello-a, hello-a, can't you see?
Hello-a, hello-a, what I feel
Hello-a, hello-a, come my way
Hello-a, hello-a, bless the day
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
But don't you think
I would do this once again
I agree I trapped
But still I would say it's not the way
 
But I just don't need
To do this all again
Now I've got you, I'm your man
You won't hear me say again
 
Hello-a, hello-a, can't you see?
Hello-a, hello-a, what I feel
Hello-a, hello-a, come my way
Hello-a, hello-a, bless the day
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hello-a, hello-a, can't you see?
Hello-a, hello-a, what I feel
Hello-a, hello-a, come my way
Hello-a, hello-a, bless the day
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hello-a, hello-a, can't you see?
Hello-a, hello-a, what I feel
Hello-a, hello-a, come my way
Hello-a, hello-a, bless the day
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma
Hooma, hooma, hooma
 
Hooma, hooma, hooma-ay
