You go, in you
Love has for you
The smile of another
I would like but cannot want in you.
From now on,
You have my help
This is not your fault
But, however, you must know
 
That after you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you...
 
Even a day, if I make my life,
If I hold the promise
Who links two beings (perhaps) forever
After you
I might be able
To give my tenderness
But not my love
 
After you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you...
