Mister
Your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder
If you know what you're looking for

Um baby
I want to keep my reputation
I'm a sensation
You try me once you'll beg for more

Oh! Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Oh! Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay, you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie, woogie all night long

No sir
I don't feel very much like talking
No neither walking
You wanna know if I can dance

Yes sir
Already told you in the first verse
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance

Oh! Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long

Yes sir, I can boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie
Boogie woogie all night long
