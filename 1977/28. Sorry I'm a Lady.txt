Ooh here comes that man again
Something in the way he moves makes me sorry I'm a Lady
Hello stranger, you're a danger
To the law and order here
They don't like men like you in our city
You're too pretty, cool and witty
You are real bad company
I should have stayed away from you today

Hey, sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Nothing dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
Have you got a light, got a light, for me tonight
Ah...

I need power, I need passion
Give me more than sympathy
I've got a lot to learn before tomorrow
Like a flower, want a shower
I want you to make me bloom
Those gentlemen in gray can here me say

Hey, sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Nothing dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
Have you got a light, got a light, for me tonight
Ah...

You are a winner, I am a sinner
No excuse, no alibi
Temptation's won the game and you are to blame

Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Nothing dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
Have you got a light, got a light, for me tonight
Ah...

Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Nothing dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
Have you got a light, got a light, for me tonight
Ah...

Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Nothing dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a Lady, sorry I'm a Lady
Have you got a light, got a light, for me tonight
Ah...
