If you want my sympathy
Just open your heart to me
And you'll get whatever you'll ever need
You think that's too high for you
Oh baby, I would die for you
When there's nothing left
You know where I'll be
Lay back in the arms of someone
Give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of some one you love
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
So baby just call on me
When you want all of me
I'll be your lover
I'll be your friend
And there's nothing I won't do
'Cause baby I just live for you
With nothing to hide
No need to pretend
Oh
Lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of some one you love
Baby
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Oh I know you think that's too high for you
Oh baby I would die for you
When there's nothing left
I'll be with you
Oh
Lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of some one you love
Baby
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Oh yeah
