I love you
a coin in mid air
if it lands heads
it means that it's over (it's enough)
let's leave each other.. (we'll break up)
 
(I love you)
Deep down I am not a cold hearted man
( I am not mean, I am a sensitive guy)
In bed I am in charge! (I command! I call the shots!)
BUT.... I tremble before your bosom
 
I hate you and I love you
 
in bed, the love we make
is like a butterfly dying
beating its wings
take my other half
(take all of me? be my other wing?)
 
today i return to her (I'm coming back from being away or I'm crawling back to her..)
1st of May,
get up courage!
 
I LOVE YOU
I ASK FOR FORGIVNESS
REMEMBER IT'S ME (remember who I am)
OPEN THE DOOR TO A SOLDIER MADE OF TISSUE PAPER
(A guy who acts tough but is as weak as piss)
 
give me your light wine (summer wine)
that you made while I was gone
and give me linen sheets,
let me sleep in them like a child
who dreams of horses and spins around (a carousel)
and (give me) some work to do..
let me wrap my arms around a woman
who sings while she irons!
and then let yourself be teased a little
(let me tease you a little/ seduce you)
before we make love
dress (cover) your anger with peace (don't be angry anymore)
and the light with your petticoat
(let me see through your petticoat in the lamp light)
 
I love you
i ask for forgiveness
remember its me
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you
