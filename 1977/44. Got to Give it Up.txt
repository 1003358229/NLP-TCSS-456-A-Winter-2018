I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
And my body yearned to be free
So I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
I'm gonna make romance
With your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
Get down and prove it, feel all right
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
