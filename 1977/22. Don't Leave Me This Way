Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive, without your love
Oh baby, don't leave me this way, no
I can't exist, I'll surely miss your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way
Ahh, baby! My heart is full of love and desire for you
Now com'on down and do what you gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning outta control
Com'on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free (set me free, set me free)
Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand I'm at your command
Oh baby please, please, don't leave me this way
No baby
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't survive, I can't stay alive without your love
Baby, don't leave me this way
Ahh, baby! My heart is full of love and desire for you
So com'on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So com'on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free (set me free, set me free)
Need you lovin', baby need it, need it
Satisfy the need in me
Satisfy the need in me
Well baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Whoa baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way
No, don't leave me this way, baby
Don't baby, don't leave me this way babe
Oh, baby
Oh, don't leave me this way, no
Don't leave me this way
