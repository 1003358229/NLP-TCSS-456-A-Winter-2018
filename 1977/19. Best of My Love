Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Flowing in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
Oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh you've got the best of my love
Demonstrating free love and affection
That you give so openly
the way I feel about you
baby, can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see
Oh oh oh oh oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh giving you the best of my love
Oh giving you the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh you've got the best of my love
Oh giving you the best of my love
