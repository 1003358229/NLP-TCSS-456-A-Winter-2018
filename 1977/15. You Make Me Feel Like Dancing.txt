You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead
I'm in a spin, you know
Shaking on a string, you know
You make me feel like dancing, I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing, I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing, dancing (whoo, whoo!)
Dance the night away (yeah!)
I feel like dancing (whoo!) dancing, aah!
Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired, no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home
You put a spell on me
I'm right where you want me to be
You make me feel like dancing, I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing, I'm gonna dance the night away
You make feel like dancing
I feel like dancing, dancing (whoo, whoo!)
Dance the night away (yeah!)
I feel like dancing (whoo!) dancing (whoo!)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing (whoo!) dancing (whoo!)
Dance the night away (yeah!)
I feel like dancing (whoo!) dancing (whoo!) oh!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lives away
You make me feel like dancing, I want to dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing, I want to dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing, I want to dance my life away
You make me feel like dancing, I want to dance my life away
You make me feel just like dancing, I want to dance my life away
