What's... what's the next song?
The one about me
Oh yeah?
I like this song
Uh-uh like Joni says...
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's--
You don't know what you've got 'til it's--
Gone
Have a feelin
Now believin
That you were the one
I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishin
Thinkin dreamin
Bout you
And the love
How'd I ever let you get away?
Got 'til it's gone
Don't- don't- don't it always--,
Don't- don't- don't it always--
Got 'til it's gone
Don't- don't- don't it always--
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
You don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
If I could turn back
The hands of time I'd make you
Fall in love
In love with me again
So would you give me
Another chance to love
To love you
In the right way no games
Got 'til it's gone
Don't- don't- don't it always--, Don't- don't- don't it always--
Here we go again...
Got 'til it's gone
Don't- don't- don't it always--, Don't- don't- don't it always--
Joni Mitchell never lies
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
1, 2... 1, 2...
Gone
Yo lemme just fuck wit it for a minute
You don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Now you're realizin when the nights go long right?
Campaign for me stay when you know that I'm gone right?
You act all wild when I tell you to settle
I was workin round the clock but your girls wanna meddle
Talkin bout, "I heard he swims with this chick on the beach."
That was out with the tide but my love you impeached
Now you lookin at the walls head in hand cold Jonezin
Ringin my house, hangin up, and then posin
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that love huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that and do that?
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
Joni Mitchell never lies
You don't know what you've got 'til it's
Gone
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Dust
