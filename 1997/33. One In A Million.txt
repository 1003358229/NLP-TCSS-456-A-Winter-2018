Baby you don't know,what you do to me.
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry.
I won't let no one come and take your place.
'Cause the love you give can't be replaced.
See no one else love me like you do.
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you.
I wanna please you in anyway I can.

It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling all day long.
