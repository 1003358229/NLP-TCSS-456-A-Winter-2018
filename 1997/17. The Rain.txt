Me I'm supa fly, supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain!)
Me I'm supa fly ('gainst my window) supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain!)
Me I'm supa fly ('gainst my window) supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I, I can't stand the rain!)
Me I'm supa fly ('gainst my window)
When the rain hits my window
I take and (inhale, cough me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight, that you get our styles Tango
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Singing Can we get kinky tonight? Like CoCo, so-so
You don't wanna play with my yo-yo
I smoke my hydro on the dee-low
Beep beep, who got the keys to the Jeep? Vroom!
I'm driving to the beach, top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be (who it be)
It be me me me and Timothy (me me!)
Look like it's bout to rain, what a shame (uh-huh)
I got the Armor-All to shine up the stain
Oh Missy, try to maintain
Icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky
I feel the wind, five six seven, eight nine ten
Begin, I sit on Hill's like Lauryn
Until the rain starts, coming down, pouring chill,
I got my umbrella
My finger waves be dazed, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me yes you lucky (I can't stand the rain!)
('gainst my window, I can't stand the rain!)
('gainst my window, I, I can't stand the rain!)
('gainst my window, I can't stand the rain!)
('gainst my window, I can't stand the rain!)
