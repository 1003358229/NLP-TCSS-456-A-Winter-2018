This goes out to all the women in the world
Especially her
You know it don't even matter your age
Don't even matter yo color
Yo fellas, I ain't forget about y'all
This is for everybody who like to dance
Just listen to what I'm sayin'
And do it
And take a chance
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can get down low
And roll it round
Just get on the floor like I said before
Y'all remember that down low
Just put a little dip with it
Now roll those hips with it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it?
I can hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance y'all
I know you like it so don't try to fight it
Turn around baby, let me see it from the back
Yeah, I like it like that
Get up now
Roll those hips
Drop down double up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right upon me
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can dip down low
And roll it round
Back again with the second verse
It's all clean so I'm not gonna curse
Droppin' bass like a bad habit
Love all women
'Cause I got to have it
Comin' at y'all in stereo
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo
Hang on baby 'cause the ride is rough and
(Yo DJ, yo DJ)
Have them girls in the front
Now or later just bumpin' that rump
Raise it up let me see that round
Slap it girl, make it jiggle around
Round and round that rump goes
Where it stop yo, no one knows, yeah
Freak Nasty wanna see
Can y'all do this right like me
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
And we can dip down low
And roll it round
"Well all right y'all
If you ain't dippin'
You must be trippin'
If you ain't doin the down low, you gots to go
To the people that's movin' slow on the dance flo'
Yo DJ
Pump it up some more"
It's off to the show in the limo
Before the show gotta get that dough
Pay them girls what they worth
Slip that money under that skirt
Take it off, baby let me see
You might get a little more loot chi-chi
String-havin thats so much fun ??
Playin' that side
Between them buns
Shorty got it on like moms
Teasin' me and she know I'm starvin'
Lick you up then like you down
But I ain't finished girl, turn around
Like you up and down your back
'Cause I'm that freaky, I'm freaky like that
Freak Nasty wanna see can y'all do this (Right like me)
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours and I put mine
Then we can dip down low
And roll it round
Settin' it off to another level
You diggin' freak nasty
Without a shovel?
This is my world
I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so what's up?
Yo DJ, when the party's getting slow
Throw on this jam on and watch them flow
Takin' over like in 94
When I had the world
Gettin' down low
New Orleans born ATL-livin
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin'
My juice is sweet like Georgia Peaches
Women suck it up like leeches (uh-huh)
It feels so good you must admit you like this shh
Yeah, y'all know the song
So come on, won't you sing along?
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put my hand upon my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand upon your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
