You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?
Show me the way don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm just thinking of you

Ooh ah, just a little bit
Ooh ah, a little bit more
Ooh ah, just a little bit
You know what I'm I'm looking for

Ooh ah, just a little bit
Ooh ah, a little bit more
Ooh ah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

Feeling good let's go all the way
It's got to be set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you?
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's more than a phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

Ooh ah, just a little bit
Ooh ah, a little bit more
Ooh ah, just a little bit
You know what I'm I'm looking for

Ooh ah, just a little bit
Ooh ah, a little bit more
Ooh ah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore

What can you do for me?
What can you do?
'Cause I feel so alive
I feel your love inside

Ooh, just a little bit a little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a little bit, a little bit more
Just a little bit, whoa whoa whoa whoa

Just a little bit
