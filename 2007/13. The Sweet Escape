If I could escape I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold'
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(The sweet escape)
If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)
I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah
You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy waiting on you to come save me
I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet'
(The sweet escape)
If I could be sweet

If I could escape, if I could escape
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor

Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold'
