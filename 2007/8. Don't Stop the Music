This little girl didn´t care what anybody said
She got the whole world dancing to the music in hear head
They loved to trash her bad, laugh at her and call her names
And now they all try to copy her, isn´t that a shame
It only made her stronger
Don´t stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and
Don´t stop the music
People keep on dancing
You can do it
Baby come on
Baby come on
He knew that he was different
This sucker couldn´t win
They didn´t dig his vision
They tried to fit him in
But there´s no room for loosers
Until they make you change
And then you love them
Tell me how much longer
Don´t stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and
Don´t stop the music
People keep on dancing
You can do it
Baby come on
Baby come on
You´ve got the perfect body, you´ve got the perfect smile
You´re unlike anybody, got your own shine
If you just keep on dancing, then you won´t feel no pain
Baby it´s your decision, only you can break
So all you gotta do is dance, come on
Music like love floating in the air
You can reach out grab it everywhere
Show you you´re special loved
You were put here on earth to make goodness for people
Better make it worth living while the world still spinning, come on!
