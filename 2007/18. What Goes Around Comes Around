Hey, girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should have known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay, baby, 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya can you tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should have known better when you came around
Should have known better that you were gonna make me cry
And now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around

Let me paint this picture for you, baby
You spend your nights alone And he never comes home
And every time you call him All you get is a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you what you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
You cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case scenario
Tale as old as time girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody That could come and make it right
But girl, I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see, see
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
See, you should have listened to me, baby
(Hey)
Because what goes around comes back around
