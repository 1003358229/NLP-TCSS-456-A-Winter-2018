Is it going? Is it going
Is it going? Is it going
I don't know what you're looking for
I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as they come, if you don't know why - I'm fly-why-why
I seen you try to switch it up, but girl you ain't got those
I'm the wonderwoman. Let me go get my rope
I'm a supermodel and mommy, sÃ­ mommy
Amnesty International got bankrupt. I'm on top, on lock
Love my ass and my abs and the video called Promiscuous
My style is ridi-di-diculous-ulous-ulous
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
When Timbo is in the party, everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mil for my beats. You get a couple gra-a-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A, way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just a piano man
Your song gonna top the charts. I heard em, I'm not a fa-a-a-an
Niggas talking greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell them that they can't do it like I can
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Could you speak up and stop m-m-mumbling
I don't think you're getting clear
If you're sitting on the top, it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you trying to act cute on TV, just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-I-it
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over, not at least until we say
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
