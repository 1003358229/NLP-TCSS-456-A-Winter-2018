You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, you set me free
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my own
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
You taught me how to cry
I don't know why, just don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free, you set me free
Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you
I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my own
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to hold you once again
If there's someone you know
That won't let you go
And taking it all for granted
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And you don't hear a word they say
I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my own
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again, once again.
