Girl, I been watching you
From so far across the floor, now baby
That's nothing new
I've watched you, so many times before, now baby
I see that look in your eyes
And what it's telling me
And you know, ooh girl that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up, on my telepathy, now baby
You're in my mind
Girl I want to shake you down
I can give you all the lovin' you need
Come on let me take you down
We'll go all the way to heaven
Ooh, I been missin' you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do?
I can tell you got your pride, now baby
Come to me, well well
Let me ease your mind, oh baby
I got the remedy, yes I do
Now give me just a little time
You're in my mind
Girl I want to shake you down
I can give you all the lovin' you need
Come on let me take you down
We'll go all the way to heaven
Girl, I been missin' you
And you know, it's funny, every time I
Get to feelin' this way, I wish I had you near me
I want to reach out and
Touch you
I can't stop thinkin' bout the things we do
The way you call me baby when I'm holdin' you
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Then you whisper in my ear, oh baby, well well
You're in my mind
Girl I want to shake you down
I can give you all the lovin you need
Come on let me take you down
We'll go all the way to heaven
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo
Come on girl let's shock the show
Roses are red and violets are blue
I'm gonna rock this world for you
