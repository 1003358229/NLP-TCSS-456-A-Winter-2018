More than an ocean,
Keeps us apart.
I feel a tearing in half of my heart.
A walk on the water,
Is all that I need.
But miracles are not happening.
You're not even listening to me.
Leaving you ain't easy now,
But loving you's the harder part.
You never want me for myself,
And I've needed you right from the very start.
Oh, won't you stay and try to:
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
And don't you make me beg for love.
Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Now listen to me.
I wish that I was wrong,
But you don't feel that way.
We drift apart with each passing day.
You never seem to notice any more.
Living in a fantasy,
There's never any room to breath.
Hoping every waking hour,
You'll turn around and say that we can stay.
Won't you even try to:
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
And don't you make me beg for love.
Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Somehow I lost my way,
Looking to see something in your eyes.
But lover will never compromise.
There is the politics of life.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
And don't you make me beg for love.
Give a sign 'cos' I need to know.
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
