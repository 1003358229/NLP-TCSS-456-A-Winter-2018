Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartace, yes I did
I escaped
I found my way out of the darkness, kept my faith
Kept my faith
And the river was deep
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh uh
With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No, I don't regret a single moment, no, I don't
I know you don't, looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do) I just laugh
When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high
I still believed
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting for me
So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we share was meant to be
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting)
I knew you were waiting, (I knew you were waiting for me)
I even thought that love
(I still believe) when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) nothing can stop me now
(Knew you were waiting, know I knew you were waiting for me)
when the mountain was high
(I still believe) oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) no, it didn't stop me
(Knew you were waiting for me, knew you were waiting for me)
oh yeah
(I still believe) oh, I still believe
(It didn't stop me) do you know it didn't stop me, now?
(Knew you were waiting) somewhere, some way, some place, somehow
For me
when the valley was low
(I still believe) I still believe
(I believe, I believe, I believe) it didn't stop me now (oh, it couldn't stop me now)
